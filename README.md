Abstract
```
This project explores autonomous delivery in smart cities using AI search and planning
algorithms. The agent navigates a 2D grid world with static and dynamic obstacles,
optimizing fuel and time costs. We implement and compare uninformed (BFS, UCS),
informed (A*), and local search replanning (simulated annealing) strategies.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates trade-offs between optimality and adaptability,
highlighting when each algorithm is best suited.

**1. Introduction**

Autonomous delivery agents are increasingly vital in smart city logistics. Companies like
Amazon and FedEx experiment with drones and ground robots that face uncertain
environments with traffic and obstacles.

In AI terms, these systems are rational agents that choose actions to maximize
efficiency given limited resources. This project evaluates classical planning algorithms
for autonomous delivery tasks on a 2D grid world.

We address two research questions:

1. Which search algorithm performs best for varying map complexities?
2. How do dynamic obstacles impact planning efficiency and optimality?
**2. Environment Model**

We define the environment as a **2D grid world** G=(V,E)G = (V,E)G=(V,E).

- Each cell v∈Vv \in Vv∈V has an integer movement cost ≥ 1, representing terrain
    difficulty.
- **Static obstacles** are impassable cells (denoted -1).
- **Dynamic obstacles** are moving vehicles, modeled either:
    o **Deterministically** with a known schedule (predictable).
    o **Unpredictably** (to stress-test local search).


The state is defined as the agent’s **grid position**.
Actions: {Up, Down, Left, Right}.
The cost function is additive across steps, and the **goal test** is reaching the delivery
destination.
Fuel and time are directly proportional to path cost.

**3. Agent Design**

The agent architecture consists of:

- **Planner** (BFS, UCS, A*, or Local Search) – computes paths.
- **Execution Module** – moves step by step.
- **Environment Monitor** – detects changes in traffic and obstacles.
- **Replanner** – recomputes alternative routes if blocked.

The agent is rational: its performance measure is **minimizing delivery cost and
avoiding collisions** under time and fuel constraints.

monitor, environment, and execution module]**

**4. Heuristics**
    - **BFS** : Explores level by level, no cost-awareness.
    - **UCS (Uniform-Cost Search)** : Guarantees optimal paths but can be slow.
    - **A** *: Uses an admissible heuristic.
       o Manhattan distance is chosen for 4-connected movement.
       o h(x,y)=∣xgoal−x∣+∣ygoal−y∣h(x,y) = |x_{goal}-x| + |y_{goal}-y|h(x,y)=∣xgoal
          −x∣+∣ygoal−y∣.
    - **Local Search (Simulated Annealing)** : Uses a cost function combining path
       length with penalties for collisions and blocked cells.

This allows flexibility when facing unpredictable traffic.

**5. Experimental Results**

**6. Analysis**
    - **BFS** : Scales poorly, good only for small grids.
    - **UCS** : Guarantees optimal paths but computationally heavy.


- **A** *: Best balance of efficiency and optimality, ideal in static or predictable
    environments.
- **Local Search** : Adapts quickly to unpredictable dynamics, though paths are
    suboptimal.

Summary:

- Use **A** * for most real-world cases.
- Use **UCS** when guaranteed optimality is required.
- Use **Local Search** when facing unpredictability.
**7. Conclusion and Future Work**

We conclude that heuristic search significantly improves delivery efficiency. Dynamic
replanning is essential for real-world deployment.

**Limitations:**

- Single-agent delivery.
- Deterministic terrain costs.

**Future Work:**

- Probabilistic planning (MDPs).
- Multi-agent coordination.
- Machine learning-based heuristic tuning.
